 <h4 style="background-color: #CCCCFF;">One of my wishlist is want to fly high see the sky. And alhamdullilah i got a chance fly go to Egypt last two years with my beloved family. the main reason is for my brother's and his wife graduation day as a Al-Azhar student. First picture taken a few minutes after our arriving at Cairo International Airport. The temperatured that time reached 12 degrees celsius. SO COLDD !! For the next days  my brother bring us to visit a historical place at there like Giza Pyramid, Montaza Palace, Ibnu Tulun Mosque, Al-Azhar Mosque and more. besides my father really like to read about the history of Islam in ancient times and he double triple excited when he can see the place by his own eyes. Other than we visit their country, we also can see the difference between our culture and arabian lifestyle.</h4>
